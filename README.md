## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- media queries
### What I learned

I learnt mobile responsive design and made use of rem values. simply changed the root font-size


```css
@media (max-width: 400px) {
    html{
        font-size: 50%;
    }
}
.qr-text h3{
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```
I also learnt how to properly use css grid.Had a lot of struggles with it and almost gave up. mostly used justify-content and gaps
```css
.qr-image-container{
    display: grid;
    justify-content: center;
}
```


### Continued development

Will be sure to develop on css-variables .
